NeonLib Tiered Paid License Agreement

This License Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between the Licensee (the "User") and NeonTheCoder (the "Licensor") and governs the use of the NeonLib software and associated documentation files (the "Software").

1. License Tiers and Fees

(a) Indie Tier: A one-time fee of $10 grants the User the rights to use the Software in commercially shipped games, provided the User or the User's organization has shipped fewer than 100,000 commercial titles.

(b) C-Tier: An additional one-time fee of $90 is required if the User or the User's organization has shipped between 100,000 and 500,000 commercial titles.

(c) A-Tier: If the User or the User's organization has shipped between 500,000 and 1,000,000 commercial titles, a per-seat fee of $5 is required. A seat refers to each computer with a Unity Project using the Software. The User must report the number of seats and make the necessary payment accordingly.

(d) AAA-Tier: If the User or the User's organization has shipped more than 1,000,000 commercial titles, a per-seat fee of $25 is required. A seat refers to each computer with a Unity Project using the Software. The User must report the number of seats and make the necessary payment accordingly.

2. License Grant

Upon payment of the applicable fee, the Licensor grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the Software in commercially shipped games, subject to the tiered license terms described in Section 1.

3. License Restrictions

The User may not sublicense, sell, or distribute the Software separately from a commercially shipped game without the express written permission of the Licensor.

4. Upgrading License Tiers

If the User's tier status changes due to the number of commercial titles shipped, the User must upgrade their license by contacting the Licensor and paying any applicable fees for the new tier.

5. Other Terms

This Agreement does not supersede or replace any terms, conditions, or requirements set forth in the NeonLib Custom License. You must include this Licensing file as well as a proof of purchase provided by the Licensor in the files of your shipped game.

By purchasing a Tiered Paid License, the User agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
